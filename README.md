# Pandas 
 ## Introduction
Hello everyone this is the scene from APSSDC in which I am going to talk about Python pandans library and it is an integral part of data analysis and serves as the building block of data analysis and data science so let us take a look at the agenda for this session.
## Agenda:
The agenda for this session l I'm going to start with the basic introduction to pandas Python
followed by data frames and series with examples and then we will see how we explore the data using pandas moving furtherâ€™ we will learn pandas operations merging grouping reshaping etc and then I will talk about plotting with pandas and finally  to sum up this session I will tell you about reading and writing files using pandas I hope you are clear with the agenda.

## What & Why Pandas:
what exactly is pandas so pandas is a Python library which is used for data manipulation analysis and cleaning, visualisation, building machine learning models, etc. and Python pandas is well-suited for different kinds of data such as we can work on tabular data and unlabeled data

## Installation: 
Now I'm going to tell you how you can install pandas on your system. You  just go to your command line or terminal and just type 

py```pip install pandas```

otherwise if you are using anaconda, just open anaconda prompt/shell and execute 

```conda install -c anaconda numpy```

## Application:
* work on economics  you can use a Python pandas for stock  prediction you can use it for recommendation systems.
* analyze the data using pandas

## Data Frames:
* data frame is a two dimensional and the size of the data frame is mutable 
* It is a table with rows and columns, with rows having an index and columns having meaningful names.
* Also called heterogeneous tabular data

## Pandas Series:
* Panda series is a one-dimensional. A dataframe is simply a table where each column is a pandas series. 
* label array capable of holding data of any type which is integer can be string float Python objects etc 
* The axis labels are collectively called index and panda series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet
